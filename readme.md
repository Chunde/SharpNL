#SharpNL (WiP)

## What is this?

> An awesome and independent reimplementation of the [Apache OpenNLP] software library in C#

## Warning

> At the moment, there is no published version, the port seems to be going well but I don't 
have any ETA for the first release. So be patient =)

So far the project has ~14,199 lines of code and counting...

## Goals

> Implement the best library of natural language processing in C#, which means:
> - Be as lightweight as possible
> - Be fully compatible with the OpenNLP library

and, perhaps one day be compatible with Standord NLP =)

## Current tasks

> - Port the OpenNLP Library ~70% done
> - Improve usability of the library
> - Improve the portuguese recognition - [CoGrOO] Project already found some good answer on how to do this.
> - Create a GUI (Only a sketch)

## Support

As a human being I like to be honest, I believe that someday our kind will transcend money... 
But unfortunately, while we have not reached this day I need some money to make my living. 
If you like this project or need to use this library in the future please consider making a 
donation (anything helps), writing this library takes a HUGE amount of my time, effort and 
resources. But I do it because I'm passionate about it, and hope to make an impact on the 
world while also sharing my little knowledge as a human being.

Please, consider donating as a thank you.
