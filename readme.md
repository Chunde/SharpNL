## Main features/characteristics

> - Fully C# managed [.net standard](https://github.com/dotnet/standard) 2.0 library!
> - Fully compatible with the OpenNLP models (1.5, 1.5.3 and 1.6).
> - Was built from scratch by hand, without any assist tool in order to maximize the synergy with .net technology.
> - There are [analyzers](https://github.com/knuppe/SharpNL/wiki/Analyzers) that help a lot the implementation and abstraction of this library.  
> - The heavy operations (like training) can be monitored and cancelled.
> - Some file formats were revamped/improved (Ad and Penn Treebank).
> - The deprecated methods from OpenNLP were not ported!
> - English inflection tools.
